Unlike text editors such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs that enable you to see as you write the final result of your edits to use Markdown, you must manually enter the corresponding syntax that indicates how text should look like on a web page. You must also mmanually enter the syntax that indicates that an image, a table, or a link must be displayed. Commonly, Technical Writers use Markdown to create documentation that is published later on the web or other platforms that \"understand\" Markdown. You can easily understand source code written in Markdown because of its almost human-like syntax. Refer to the Official Markdown Getting Started guide to learn more about what Markdown is. In this page, you can read the following: Markdown Basic Syntax Viideo Resources Creating Your First Markdown File Example Markdown Basic Syntax This section presents the basic Markdown syntax that enable you to emphasize your text, liist elements, indicate that a piece of text is a code snippet, and add tables and images to your document. Main Headings Use the following syntax for main headings: Heading Syntax Example Heading 1 # This is a Heading 1 Heading 2 ## This is a Heading 2 Heading 3 ### This is a Heading 3 Heading 4 #### This is a Heading 4 Paragraphs Use blank lines to separate a new paragraph from a previous text. For example: If you intend to separate the following text into two paragraphs, do the following: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. Don't do the following: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. Text Emphasis You can emphasize a text by making it bold , italic , or bold and intalic . Use the following syntax to emphazise text: Emphasis Syntax Example Bold **bold** This text is bold Italic *italic* This text is italic Bold and Italic ***bold and italic*** This text is bold and italic Lists You can create ordered and unordered lists using Markdown. Use numbers to create ordereded lists: Element 1 Element 2 Element 3 Use asterisks to create unordered liists: * Element * Other element * Another element Links Use the following syntax to link text: [Text of the Link](http:\\\\link.URL.com) The result is the following: Text of the Link For example: GitHub Official Logos Use the following format to link text to other sections of the document: [See Lists.](#Lists) The result is the following: See Lists. Images Use the following syntax to insert an image to your document: <img src=\"your.image.url\"> For example, use the syntax below to insert a dog's image: <img src=\"https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/89/52/cute-little-dog-cartoon-vector-20778952.jpg\"> The result is: Code Block Use backtickts (`) to enclose code blocks. Tables Use pipes (|) to separate each column and three or more hyphens (---) to create each column\u2019s headers. | Header 1 | Header 2 | | ----------- | ----------- | | Element 1.1 | Element 1.2 | | Element 2.1 | Element 2.2 | The result of the previous code is the following: Header 1 Header 2 Element 1.1 Element 1.2 Element 2.1 Element 2.2 More About the Syntax Refer to the Markdown Guide Basic Syntax guide to learn in more detail about how to use the Markdown syntax. Video Resources You can see the following videos that can help you further understand what Markdown is and to use it. Creating Your First Markdown File To create your first Markdown file: Open Visual Studio Code. Click the File option of the main menu. A sub-menu appears. Select the New File option. An empty window is displayed in Visual Studio Code. Copy and paste the Markdown code provided in the Example section of this page. Save the file as example.md . Right click the file on the left panel. A menu appears. Select the Open Preview option. Another window opens in which you can see how your file looks like after being published. Example The current page was written in Markdown, using HTMML to embed the Youtube video.
