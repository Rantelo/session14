# Welcome to the sample documentation project!

## Congratulations on finishing the Academy

This is a sample project to showcase the construction of an static site by using industry standard tools.

You can create a website like this by using the following technologies:

- [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#:~:text=MkDocs%20is%20a%20fast%2C%20simple,a%20single%20YAML%20configuration%20file.): As the static site generator
    - [MarkDown](markdown.md): To write the text
- [Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOTqprHv1YE): To install and run the project in different machines avoiding difficult configurations
- [Git and Github](github.com): To store the code remotely
    - [GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY): As the web host
    - [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): To automate the deployment of your site
